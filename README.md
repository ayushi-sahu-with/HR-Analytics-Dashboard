# HR-Analytics-Dashboard

I developed an HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI, focusing on employee attrition analysis. The project visualizes key metrics like attrition by education, age, job role, salary slabs, and years at the company, along with correlations to job satisfaction. Skills utilized include data analysis, data visualization, and HR analytics.
